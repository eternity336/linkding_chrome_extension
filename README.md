# Linkding Bookmarks Chrome Extension

A comprehensive browser extension for the self-hosted bookmarking service, [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding). Access, manage, and add bookmarks directly from your browser's toolbar, side panel, or context menu.

This extension is built with performance and usability in mind, offering a fast, cached, and highly customizable interface to your bookmarks.

## Features

*   **Multiple Views**: Access your bookmarks in the way that suits you best.
    *   **Popup**: A compact, traditional dropdown from the toolbar icon.
    *   **Side Panel**: A persistent view in the browser's side panel, perfect for power users.
    *   **Manager Page**: A full-tab experience for advanced searching and management.
*   **Configurable Display Mode**: Choose whether the toolbar icon opens the Popup or the Side Panel from the options page.
*   **Nested Folder View**: Bookmarks are automatically organized into a collapsible folder tree based on their tags (e.g., a bookmark with the tag `dev.js` appears in a `js` folder inside a `dev` folder).
*   **Full CRUD & UX**:
    *   **Create**: Add bookmarks for the current tab or from any link on a page via the context menu.
    *   **Read**: Instantly search and filter all bookmarks.
    *   **Update**: Inline editing for title, URL, description, and tags, complete with tag autocompletion.
    *   **Delete**: Remove bookmarks with a single click.
*   **Drag & Drop**: Intuitively move bookmarks between folders (tags) by dragging them.
*   **Optimistic UI**: All actions (edit, delete, move) update the interface instantly without collapsing your folder structure, providing a seamless experience.
*   **Customizable UI**: Tailor the interface to your needs. Separately for the Popup and Side Panel, you can:
    *   Toggle the visibility of tags under each bookmark.
    *   Toggle the visibility of action buttons (Edit, Delete, Drag & Drop).
*   **Performance First**:
    *   All bookmarks are fetched and cached locally to provide an instant-loading experience.
    *   The cache is automatically invalidated when you make changes.
*   **Dark/Light Mode**: The UI automatically adapts to your system's color scheme preference.

## Installation

As this extension is not yet on the Chrome Web Store, you can install it from the source code.

1.  Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  Open your Chromium-based browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.).
3.  Navigate to the extensions page. This is typically `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
4.  Enable **"Developer mode"** using the toggle switch, usually found in the top-right corner.
5.  Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
6.  Select the directory where you cloned or downloaded the extension's source code.

## Configuration

Before you can use the extension, you need to connect it to your Linkding instance.

1.  Right-click the extension icon in your toolbar and select **"Options"**.
2.  In the **Connection Settings** section:
    *   Enter the full URL of your Linkding instance (e.g., `https://bookmarks.example.com`).
    *   Create an API token in your Linkding instance under **Settings â†’ Integrations** and paste it into the **API Token** field.
3.  Click **"Save and Connect"**. The extension will test the connection and show a success or failure message.
4.  (Optional) Configure your preferred **Display Mode** and **UI Settings** on the same page. Changes are saved automatically.

## Usage

*   **Accessing Bookmarks**: Click the toolbar icon to open the Popup or Side Panel (based on your settings).
*   **Adding the Current Tab**: Open the Popup/Side Panel and click the `+` button in the header.
*   **Adding a Link**: Right-click any link on a webpage and select **"Bookmark this link in Linkding"** from the context menu.
*   **Searching**: Use the search bar in the Popup, Side Panel, or Manager to filter your bookmarks in real-time.
*   **Refreshing**: Click the refresh icon to manually fetch the latest bookmarks from your server, bypassing the cache.
*   **Managing**:
    *   Click the **"Manage Bookmarks"** button in the Popup/Side Panel footer to open the full-page Manager.
    *   In the Manager, you can right-click on folders to create sub-folders, rename, or remove them.

## Development

This extension is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external frameworks to keep it lightweight and fast.

### File Structure

*   `manifest.json`: Defines the extension's permissions, scripts, and capabilities.
*   `background.js`: The service worker that handles background tasks like setting the display mode and managing context menus.
*   `view.js`: **Shared logic** for both the Popup and Side Panel views. It handles API calls, data caching, rendering, and user interactions.
*   `popup.html` / `popup.css`: The view and styles for the toolbar popup.
*   `side_panel.html` / `side_panel.css`: The view and styles for the browser side panel.
*   `manager.html` / `manager.js` / `manager.css`: The full-page bookmark manager view, logic, and styles.
*   `options.html` / `options.js` / `options.css`: The extension's options page for configuration.
*   `icons/`: Extension icons for various resolutions.

### How it Works

1.  **Data Fetching**: The extension fetches all bookmarks from the Linkding `/api/bookmarks/` endpoint (handling pagination) and stores them in `chrome.storage.local` for a set duration (e.g., 15 minutes).
2.  **UI Rendering**: `view.js` (for Popup/Side Panel) and `manager.js` take the flat list of bookmarks and build a hierarchical "tag tree" by splitting tags containing periods (`.`). This tree is then rendered as a nested, collapsible list of folders.
3.  **State Management**: The open/closed state of folders is preserved during UI re-renders (e.g., after a search or an edit), ensuring a non-disruptive user experience.
4.  **Reactivity**: The extension listens for changes to `chrome.storage.sync` (where settings are stored) and automatically reloads the view to reflect new UI preferences.
